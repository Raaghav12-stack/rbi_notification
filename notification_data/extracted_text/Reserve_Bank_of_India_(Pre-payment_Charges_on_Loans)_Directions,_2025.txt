Reserve Bank of India (Pre-payment Charges on Loans) Directions, 2025
Availability of easy and affordable financing to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs)1is of paramount importance. However, Reserve Bank’s supervisory reviews have indicated divergent practices amongst Regulated Entities (REs) with regard to levy of pre-payment charges in case of loans sanctioned to MSEs which lead to customer grievances and disputes. Further, certain REs have been found to include restrictive clauses in loan contracts/ agreements to deter borrowers from switching over to another lender, either for availing lower rates of interest or better terms of service. Accordingly, as announced in theStatement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 9, 2024, adraft circularin this regard was issued on February 21, 2025 for public consultation.
