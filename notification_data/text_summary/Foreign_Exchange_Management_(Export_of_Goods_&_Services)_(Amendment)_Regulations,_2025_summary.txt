The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has amended the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods & Services) Regulations, 2015 to allow the export of specific vessels with a new condition. The amendment now permits the export of tugs or tug boats, dredgers, and vessels used for providing offshore support services, and includes a requirement for their re-import into India.
