The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expanded its recognition of credit rating agencies for capital adequacy purposes by permitting banks to use the ratings of CareEdge Global IFSC Limited for risk weighting claims on non-resident corporates originating at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). This new regulatory change is an addition to the existing recognition of ratings from Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poorâ€™s as specified in the Basel III Capital Regulations.
